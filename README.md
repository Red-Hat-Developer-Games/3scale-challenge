# Deploy your API into 3scale with Jenkins

Welcome to the challenge,

I hope you enjoy it. In this challenge you will need to create an OpenAPI Spec, After it you will need to create a RESTful API(Choose your desired language), Deploy it in your namespace(userX). Then, using the 3Scale toolbox(Add 3scale-toolbox secret), deploy the API by creating a BuildConfig of type Pipeline. Your namespace already has a Jenkins instance configured to fire the Pipeline build.
